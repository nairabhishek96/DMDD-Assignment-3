# DMDD-Assignment-3


Topic description:
When Abhishek and I arrived in Boston for our Master's program, it was an arduous task among 500+ students to find used essential items like study tables, chairs, bed frames, study lamps, etc. University Marketplace Database project is a database of used or pre-owned essential items for peer to peer buying/selling created for university students. The project addresses two issues:
Mostly buying/selling of used items is done on instant messengers like Whatsapp via multiple groups. This creates a decentralized environment where it is difficult to keep track of all the buying/selling opportunities.
On general platforms like Facebook Marketplace or Ebay, the buyers/sellers might not be trustworthy and/or may be located at an inconvenient distance from the university.
We are trying to resolve these issues by creating a centralized database of pre-owned essential items that can be accessed at a single place. The marketplace will be segregated based on universities to make sure that buyers and sellers are located at a reasonable distance. We will be using users' university email address for the verification purpose. Along with the general details of the product, distance of each product from the buyers will be computed based on the lag-long coordinates. This will help buyers decide which seller to buy from. We are also planning to incorporate a premium subscription feature into the project for sellers. This subscription will enable the sellers to list their products at the top of the search results.
Files:
Python file (ipynb) consists of the script for fetching data frame various sources, cleaning and formatting the data to fit our database, auditing the data for consistency, accuracy and completeness, and inserting the data into MySQL database. It also consists of the insert queries for inserting data into database. Also, we have documented the python script such that it is easily readable by the user.
PDF document consists of all the other requirements like the list of data sources, SQL to insert data into database, use case description and its queries.
Tests: We have conducted various tests to identify missing values and outliers.
